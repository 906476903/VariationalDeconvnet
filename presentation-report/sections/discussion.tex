short recap

\subsection{Comparison with fully connected MLP}
Even though multiple convolutional layers are often used in CNN's, a one-layer DNN is potentially interesting as an encoder because the number of weights is lower than in traditional auto-encoders due to weight-sharing. 
\subsection{Future Work}

%bugs: 
%-spatialconvolutionCUDA doesn't work for 1-layer-7, where SpatialZeroPadding does work
