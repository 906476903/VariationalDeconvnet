Convolutional Neural Networks are a powerful blablabla. \\
However, so far only supervised methods--> need for training unsupervised. \\
Enter SGVB and explain how this works with convnets (connection to graphical models?)
\subsection{Related Work}
Auto-encoder, Zeilers deconv, not much...

\subsection{This Project}
explain main goal: get unsupervised convnet to work \\
